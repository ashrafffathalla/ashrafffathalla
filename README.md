- Software Engineer
- Mobile developer ( Flutter | Android )
- A mobile app developer is able to create software for phones and tablets, and is familiar with the newest technologies in the mobile world. Mobile development requires staying in the mobile head space, meaning that it's even more important than with other hardware contexts to optimize performance, battery, network, and memory management. A developer must be also aware of how to deal with device fragmentation,often working closely with a designer to achieve the best user experience (UX) results.

<h2> Samples from my projects </h2>

### XO Game
Now you can play Tic Tac Toe on your Android device for free. Our new modern version appears in a cool glow design
The Tic Tac Toe game is a game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeded in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
The Tic Tac Toe is a great way to pass your free time whether you're standing in a line or spending time with friends.
Stop wasting paper and save trees. Because of the simplicity of Tic Tac Toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence.
